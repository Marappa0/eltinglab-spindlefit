# eltinglab-spindlefit
A program for fitting curves to microscope images.

This program was made specifically for a project on 
measuring arc length and curvature of Pombe mitotic 
spindles. However, this can easily be adapted to work 
for many biological image applications.

As it stands, the program uses a MatLab app to fit
a quadratic equation to a .tif image or video frame.
It then uses that equation to return data about the
object in question.
